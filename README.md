# EnergeticOverviewEMENA
A Data visualization Project about energy technologies and efficiency in Europe, Middle East and North Africa

## Data Sources

[Energy](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/EnergeticOverviewEMENA/blob/main/World%20Energy%20Consumption.csv) Dataset has been also acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption) which come from ["Our World in Data"](https://ourworldindata.org/). Since 2019 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data was not available in the Kaggle's dataset at the moment of its download, [it](https://github.com/ArnaldoMatute/EnergeticOverviewEMENA/blob/main/gross-domestic-product.csv) has been complemented by downloading it straight from the ["Our World in Data"](https://ourworldindata.org/) website.


## Metrics to consider
Images to produce will contain piecharts for every country in the EMENA region placed geographically over maps produced with Cartopy. Their radii will be proportional to the percapita electricity consumption for each country. Moreover, the ratio of electricity consumption per GDP will be mapped through the color of the country in the map. So this image will offer at a glance:
- Share of each technologie used to produce electricity in each country through the piechart.
- Through the piechart size, per capita electricity consumption.
- Electricity consumption per unit of GDP (Millions of 2015 US dollars) through the color of the country on the map.

Zoom in to the Balkans and Middle East for the sake of clarity.
